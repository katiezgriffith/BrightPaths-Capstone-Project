I have decided to take a previous project I worked on and build it out more to become a Dream Vacation Database.

First you navigate to localhost.5500/client in your local browser.

Next up, Load the landing page.

Take a look around. You will see an input field that will allow you to input where you would like to to, a cost estimate, and image URL field to input a picture
of where your dream destination.

You will also see a couple of suggestions of some popular global destinations that includes a picture and cost estimate.

So where would you like to go? How about Rome, Italy to see the Collesium?
Let's go and input our destination.

Now DREAM IT! (Click Dream It button)

And there it is! Your destination will populate on your database.

Now what? Do you need inspiration? Got you covered. Navigate to the top right of the page to the pink button labeled "Need Inspiration"

This button will direct you to a youtube video of Top Travel Destinations in 2021.

But wait, what if you over estimated or underestimated your vacations cost and want to adjust accordingly?
There's a button(s) for that! Navigate to your destination and toggle the + and - buttons to adjust your guesstimate accordingly.
